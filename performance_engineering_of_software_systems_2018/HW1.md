### Homework 1: Getting Started

A good software engineer strives to write programs that are fast, correct, and maintainable.

* Maintainability: comment your code, use meaningful variable names, insert whitespaces,
  and follow a consistent style.

* Code organization: break up large functions into smaller subroutines, write reusable
  helper functions, and avoid duplicate code.

* Version control: write descriptive commit messages, and commit your changes frequently,
  but dont commit anything which doesn't compile.

* Assertions: frequently make assertions within your code so that you know quickly when
  something goes wrong.
